Completed a state-of-the-art Next Word Predictor project using NLP and deep learning. This project involved advanced techniques such as tokenization, sequential processing, padding, an LSTM architecture, and embedding layers to accurately predict the next word in a sequence. By treating this as a supervised machine learning task, I achieved a remarkable accuracy of 97.39% and minimized the loss to just 0.0847. Key technologies used in this project include scikit-learn and TensorFlow. I look forward to further exploring and contributing to advancements in AI and machine learning!
